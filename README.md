Common RL framework and utilities.

## Design considerations

* maximize module reuse under RL framework
* accumulate experiment baselines for algorithm, with hyperparam setup, easily reproducible
* accumulate experiment baselines for problems, with algorithm/hyperparam/engineering efforts
* easily implement more algorithms
* easily combine different works

## Initial algorithm set

* DQN
* DDPG
* Replay Buffer
* Prioritized Exp Replay
* Double DQN
* Duel DQN
